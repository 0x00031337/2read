# Convert article in current tab to readable form and upload it to P2P network (IPFS).

Please note that content shared with this addon is just cached on IPFS servers. If you want to store the content permanently, you need to have IPFS node running on your computer. You can easily install your local IPFS node using one of these desktop clients:

* [ipfs-desktop](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop/releases)
* [Orion](https://orion.siderus.io/)

2read will automatically "pin" your content if you have local node running.
